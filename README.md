=================

This project is still in what you might be kind enough to call pre-alpha. It's "pretty cool" but not much else.

Well, I say that but you -can- manually do a heck of a lot with this little bitty. 

- Style a map with CSS, 
- have nodes shoot events
- talk to nodes and animate them on your own

Wait stop the presses.

This readme is pretty much over. We need to animate this thing and make it browseable. 
Also there's probably a ton of optimization that need to be found.
Also also, I need to fix the jQuery wrapping and class reflection. Derp.

Please help out if you can, I'll help you integrate this thing into whatever if you do!

I'm incorporating it into a CMS, report generator, activity monitor and event viewing tool.
Also trying to make a data modeler next.
